# correlation_function_g2
Python code on the pair corrlation function g2 for the study of super-resolution images as a part of an internship I've done in 2017 at LPT (Toulouse, http://www.lpt.ups-tlse.fr/?lang=fr) with Nicolas Destainville.

Most of the work presented here is greatly inspired from Veatch et al., Correlation Functions Quantify Super-Resolution Images and Estimate Apparent Clustering Due to Over-Counting, PLoS One. 2012; 7(2): e31457 ; 

which can be found here : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3288038/#s3

and its well detailed Materials and Methods which presents a MatLab function for the computation of the pair correlation function that I here present in Python.
